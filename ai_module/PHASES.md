# Conversation Phases

The AI sales agent operates with **two simple phases**:

## 1. Building Rapport ü§ù

**Goal**: Build a genuine friendship with the student through engaging conversation

**What to do:**

- Ask questions about their projects and interests
- Show genuine interest and curiosity
- Keep it short and friendly
- Sound like a friend, not a salesperson
- Relate to their situation (school grind, balancing everything)

**Transition criteria to "doing_the_ask":**

- Student has asked at least 1 question back (showing engagement)
- At least 5+ messages exchanged (built some rapport)
- Positive sentiment (student seems interested)
- Good engagement (meaningful responses, not just "ok" or "yeah")

## 2. Doing The Ask üí∞

**Goal**: Introduce Prodicity and guide them to the application

**What to do:**

- Naturally transition from their interests to Prodicity
- Highlight value proposition (helping them ship outcomes)
- Address their specific needs
- Be ready to handle objections (cost, time, etc.)
- Guide toward application link when ready

**When to stay in "building_rapport":**

- If student shows strong negative sentiment (< -0.3)
- If student says "no", "not interested", "can't", etc.
- If engagement drops (short, uninterested responses)

## Phase Detection

The system analyzes:

- **Sentiment**: Positive/negative keywords in responses
- **Engagement**: Message length, personal pronouns, asking questions
- **Message count**: How many back-and-forths have happened
- **Questions**: Is the student asking questions back?

## Example Flow

```
Building Rapport (Messages 1-5):
"hey Ivan, I'm currently looking at what students at lynbrook are working on..."
"Yeah! I'm building a mobile app"
"that's really cool‚Äîwhat sparked that?"
"well I noticed the cafeteria waste problem and thought..."
"love that‚Äîhow are you balancing that with AP classes?"

[AI detects: 5 messages, questions asked, positive engagement]

TRANSITION TO: Doing The Ask (Message 6+):
"your vibe around this is exactly what we're looking for at Prodicity..."
```

Perfect. Now you have a **clean, simple two-phase system**:

1. Build rapport until the student is optimally engaged
2. Then do the ask and guide them to the application
