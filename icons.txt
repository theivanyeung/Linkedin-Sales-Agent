# Simple placeholder icon files for Chrome extension
# In a real implementation, you would create actual PNG icon files

# For now, the extension will work without icons
# To add icons later:
# 1. Create 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG files
# 2. Name them icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png
# 3. Place them in the extension root directory
